# Calculator
Simple web calculator

UI inspired by https://www.uxfree.com/calculator-app-ui-sketch-resource/

Calculator with a simple story of calculations done in the "H" button (refresh page will erase the story). Works like a regular calculator.
Max number digits is 13. Calculation beyond that will return an error.
